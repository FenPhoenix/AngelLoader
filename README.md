## Description
AngelLoader is a standalone fan mission loader for Thief 1, Thief 2, Thief 3, and System Shock 2. Unlike FMSel, which requires a separate copy for each game, AngelLoader allows you to manage and play all your FMs in one place. The interface is inspired by DarkLoader (by Bj√∂rn Henke and Tom N. Harris) and NewDarkLoader (by Robin Collier).

## Features
- Manage all your FMs in one place
- Select multiple FMs at a time to quickly mark them all finished, install them in bulk, etc.
- Search and filter your FM collection by many criteria
- Automatically detects metadata for every FM: title, author, game, release date, etc. No need to type it in!
- Organize your games by tab or treat them as filters
- Disable visual or other mods on a per-FM basis with a simple visual list (no more typing an arcane string into a textbox!)
- Choose which language to play with on a per-FM basis
- Import your FM information from DarkLoader, NewDarkLoader, or FMSel
- Automatically fixes common problems, such as:
  - Non-16-bit audio causing static
  - Custom palettes not being applied properly to FMs (Ranstall Keep etc.)
  - Local values left in global config files by NewDark (character_detail)
- Option to automatically use old mantling for OldDark missions
- Supports light and dark themes
- Plays nice with other loaders: AngelLoader doesn't store any .dlls or data files in your game folders, making it truly portable and non-intrusive

## Installing
Simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/FenPhoenix/AngelLoader/releases) and unzip it to a folder of your choice. For example, `C:\AngelLoader`. New versions can be extracted right on top of old ones: your data files will not be overwritten.

*Note: Some folders are considered "protected" (`Program Files` / `Program Files (x86)` are examples) and AngelLoader should not be placed anywhere in these folders or it may not (probably won't) work.*

.NET Framework 4.7.2 or above is required. All modern versions of Windows should come with this already.

## Building
- Use Visual Studio 2022, .NET Framework 4.7.2 targeting, also going to need the C++ workload installed.
- Use Release_Public / x86 for the standard AngelLoader build. See [here](https://github.com/FenPhoenix/AngelLoader/blob/master/FOR_OTHER_PROGRAMMERS.md) for an explanation of the other profiles. x64 is believed to work fine if you want to try that, but it has not been tested nearly as much as the x86 build.
- All dependencies now are either NuGet packages or are included in the bin_dependencies folder, so you should be able to just build with no fuss now.
