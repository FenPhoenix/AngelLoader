## Description
AngelLoader is a modern, standalone fan mission loader for Thief 1, Thief 2, Thief 3, and System Shock 2. Current loaders for those games (FMSel, NewDarkLoader) must be attached to each game individually, necessitating multiple installs, multiple setting of config options, the inability to manage all your missions in one place, etc. AngelLoader is a one-stop shop for all your missions: every FM can be viewed, played, edited, installed, and uninstalled from one place.

The list of fan missions is filterable by game and many other criteria, and provides the option to either organize games by tab or to treat them as ordinary filters.

The interface is inspired by DarkLoader (by Bj√∂rn Henke and Tom N. Harris) and NewDarkLoader (by Robin Collier). AngelLoader emulates the classic DarkLoader/NewDarkLoader UI design, with its simple "everything at your fingertips" layout making for a quick and intuitive experience. It also incorporates features from NewDarkLoader and FMSel, such as tags, filtering, rating, optional audio file conversion, etc.

FM loaders have traditionally had FM scanning functionality, and AngelLoader's scanner is second to none, detecting titles and authors from the trickiest of fan missions with a speed and accuracy rate not seen from any loader before. It also detects NewDark game types accurately, in contrast to DarkLoader which requires manual editing of its .ini file in order for NewDark Thief 1 missions to work.

In short, AngelLoader aims to be a complete successor to DarkLoader, being an all-in-one loader and manager with an intuitive interface, high performance, and many features both classic and modern.
