## Localizable text changelog for the benefit of translators

#### NOTE! In English.ini, all lines beginning with ; are merely comments to assist the translator and are not required to be translated themselves.

If you want to update a translation from several versions back and don't want to go through the changes one by one, you can diff the old and new files yourself using a tool like [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/downloads/).

<h3><a name="initial_setup" />Initial setup</h3>

<p>When you start AngelLoader for the first time, you'll see the initial setup window:</p>

<h4>Language</h4>
If other languages are available, you can choose them here. Changes will take effect immediately.

<h4><a name="paths_to_game_exes" />Paths to game executables</h4>
Here you can choose the executable files for the supported games you have installed. These fields are optional - you can set some, all, or none. You will still be able to see and manage all of your fan missions even if you haven't set their corresponding executable, but of course you won't be able to install or play any of them unless their executable is set.
<p><b>Thief 1</b>, <b>Thief 2</b> and <b>System Shock 2</b> must be patched with NewDark in order for AngelLoader to be able to use them. <b>Thief 3</b> must be patched with the Sneaky Upgrade. Version 1.1.9.1 or above is recommended; while versions as far back as 1.1.3 may work, they haven't been tested and are not officially supported.</p>

<h4>Steam options</h4>
If you own one or more supported games on Steam, you can specify the location of <code>steam.exe</code> and choose which games should be launched through it. Launching a game in this way enables access to Steam features such as the in-game overlay, play time counter, etc.

<h4>Startup scan</h4>
Whenever new FMs are detected, they will be automatically scanned. If you cancel the scan, then they will be scanned when manually selected, similar to DarkLoader. It's recommended that you let the scan finish, especially if you're using game tabs, as it will result in FMs being categorized properly.

<h4>Filter bar</h4>
Here you can choose to filter your FM list by game, title, author, release date, last played date, tags, finished status, and rating. If you've chosen to organize your games by tab, then these tabs will take the place of the game filter buttons.

- <h4>Readme area</h4>
+ <h4><a name="readme_area" />Readme area</h4>
Here is where the selected FM's readme is displayed. If there are multiple readmes, AngelLoader will attempt to detect one that doesn't contain spoilers (lootlists, walkthroughs, etc.).
If it finds one, it will choose that readme automatically. If a non-spoiler readme is unable to be detected with certainty, you will be given a choice of which readme to view.
In this case, this list of readmes will be the only thing displayed in the readme section. Once you've selected a readme, you will thereafter
have the option to select another from a drop-down list that appears in the upper-right corner (see <a href="#readme_controls">Readme controls</a>).

This is the main area where fan missions are displayed, sorted, and filtered. You can change the columns' size, <a href="#column_header_context_menu">visibility</a>, and order.
Drag a column left or right to change its order. Clicking on a column header will sort by that column. Click once to sort by ascending, and click again to sort by descending.

Press the Delete key while an FM is selected to delete that FM's archive from disk. You will be asked for confirmation first.

<p>You can zoom the FMs list either with the zoom buttons on the top bar, or with <code>Ctrl++</code>,<code>Ctrl+-</code>, and <code>Ctrl+0</code>, or with Ctrl+mousewheel.

<p><img src="images/tags_tab.png" /></p>

Here you can manage the FM's tags. You can click the <b>Add from list...</b> button to choose a tag from the global list (which includes standard presets as well as any other tags that have been found for any other FMs), or you can start typing in the textbox to see a real-time list of tags and categories that match what you've typed. If no matching tag or category is found, a new one is created. The format for creating a new tag is <code>category: tag</code>. If you don't specify a category when creating a new tag, that tag will be placed in the <code>misc</code> category.

<h4>Startup scan</h4>
- Whenever new FMs are detected, they will be quick-scanned for game type only. If you cancel the scan, then the game types will remain blank and will be scanned when selected, similar to DarkLoader. It's recommended that you let the scan finish, especially if you're using game tabs, as it will result in FMs being categorized properly.

This allows archives marked as Unknown (<img src="images/red_circle_question_mark_21.png" />) (archives that were rejected as not being FMs) to be displayed in the list. If support for new games is added in the future, you can use this to show previously unsupported FMs so you can re-scan them individually if you wish.

+ <h4><a name="show_recent_at_top" />Show recently added FMs at the top of the list</h4>
+ This will cause recently added FMs to be highlighted and displayed at the top of the list. This makes it easier to find FMs that you've just downloaded, for example. The number of days to consider an FM "recent" can be changed in the <a href="#settings_days_recent">Settings window</a>. The default is 15 days.
+
<h4>Refresh from disk button</h4>
Reloads the list of FMs from disk. This will always occur on startup, but this button is useful if you've added new FMs since starting AngelLoader.
<br>The list can also be refreshed from disk by pressing <code>Shift-F5</code> when the <a href="#mission_list">mission list</a> is focused.

```

```diff
<h4><a name="edit_fm_tab" />Edit FM tab</h4>

Here you can edit an FM's data. If you want to re-scan for a certain field, click the <img src="images/scan_14.png" /> icon beside the field.

<h4>Alternate titles button</h4>
Sometimes, multiple different titles will be detected during a scan. If the default title doesn't look correct, try clicking this dropdown button to see if another is available. Clicking an alternate title will change the FM's title to the one that you've selected.

<h4>Release date and Last played</h4>
If a date hasn't been scanned for or cannot be detected, its checkbox will be unchecked and no date will be shown.

<h4>Disabled mods</h4>
You can disable certain mods per-mission here. To see which mods you have installed, look at <code>cam_mod.ini</code> in your game folder. This string must be in the format <code>modname1+modname2+modname3</code> etc. So to disable the Enhancement Pack 2, it should be:

<p><code>ep2</code></p>

<p>To disable the Enhancement Pack 2 and the HD mod, it would be:</p>

<p><code>ep2+hdmod</code></p>

<p>To disable all mods for the current FM, check the <b>Disable all mods</b> checkbox.</p>

+ <h4>Language selection</h4>
+ Here you can choose to play an FM in a particular language. Only languages the FM supports will be available.
+
<h4>Comment tab</h4>

<p><img src="images/comment_tab.png" /></p>

Here you can enter a comment for the FM. This comment will also be displayed in the Comments column (up to the first 100 characters or the first linebreak, whichever comes first), and will update as you type.

<h3><a name="settings_fm_display_section" />FM Display section</h3>

<p><img src="images/setup_fm_display_tab.png" /></p>

<h4>Game organization</h4>
Here you can choose to either organize games into their own tabs, or to display your FMs as one list and allow filtering by game. When game tabs are enabled, each game will have its own selected FM and set of filters that will be retained between tab switches. Organizing games by tab can make things cleaner, but if you want to filter without regard to game (say, to find all missions by a single author who has released missions for multiple games), then having one list with game filters will work better.

<p>
  If you select the <b>Use short names on game tabs</b> checkbox, game tabs will be displayed with abbreviated names to save screen space.
</p>

<h4><a name="settings_sorting" />Sorting</h4>
Here you can choose to ignore leading articles when sorting FMs. For example, the FM "The Seven Sisters" will be considered to start with an "S". If you choose to move articles to the end of names when displaying them, then "The Seven Sisters" will be displayed as "Seven Sisters, The". The default set of articles is "a, an, the", but you can add more (for example to support other languages). These articles are not part of the normal localization functionality, because they apply to fan mission names, which can be any language; therefore the app-wide language setting doesn't apply to them.

<h4><a name="settings_rating_display_style" />Rating display style</h4>
Here you can choose the style in which to display an FM's rating (0-10, 0-5, or 0-5 with stars).

<h4><a name="settings_date_format" />Date format</h4>
Here you can choose how to display dates: either in the short or long form of your PC's current culture, or a custom format.

+ <h4><a name="settings_days_recent" />Recent FMs</h4>
+ When choosing to <a href="#show_recent_at_top">show recently added FMs at the top of the list</a>, only FMs added within the selected number of days will be included.

<h4>Game organization</h4>
Here you can choose to either organize games into their own tabs, or to display your FMs as one list and allow filtering by game. When game tabs are enabled, each game will have its own selected FM and set of filters that will be retained between tab switches. Organizing games by tab can make things cleaner, but if you want to filter without regard to game (say, to find all missions by a single author who has released missions for multiple games), then having one list with game filters will work better.

+  If you select the <b>Use short names on game tabs</b> checkbox, game tabs will be displayed with abbreviated names to save screen space.
