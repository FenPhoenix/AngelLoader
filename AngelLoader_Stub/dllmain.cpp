/*
We have NewDark executables call out to this stub program, which provides the NewDark game with data that has
been passed to it by AngelLoader via a temp file. We do it this way in order to support AngelLoader being
standalone.

We can pass certain things on the command line, but one thing we can't pass is disabled mods, so we hard require
this stub for that at the very least.
