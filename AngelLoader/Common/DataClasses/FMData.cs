// FenGen reads this and outputs fast ini read and write methods.
/*
 Notes to self:
    -Keep names shortish for more performance when reading
    -I told myself to version-header ini files right from the start, but I didn't. Meh.


@MEM(FMData): We could get rid of some stuff in here, like TagsString is an easy candidate
-We could also, if we're clever, get rid of some other stuff we nominally need, like MarkedRecent. We could
 have like an internal hashset where we put all "recent" FMs into and remove them from it as appropriate.
 Same with MarkedUnavailable. In fact, we could do that for all fields expected to _usually_ be false.
-We could squeeze all value types and enums down to their smallest possible representation, sbyte/byte/ushort
 etc.
