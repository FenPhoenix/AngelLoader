    NOTE: ReadmeRichTextBoxCustom: Memory leak on Windows' side
    The RichTextBox leaks memory when new content is loaded when ReadOnly == false. It does NOT appear to leak
    when ReadOnly == true. But we need ReadOnly to be false during load, otherwise we lose some of the images.
    In real-world use the leak should not be very significant on average (1.4.8 exhibits it too, which means it's
    probably always been there and it took me this long to notice). It can be made to happen very visibly by
    selecting "An Enigmatic Treasure With A Recondite Discovery" and then switching between Classic and Dark
    modes rapidly.

    2021-05-27:
    Tested with a new project, WinForms, .NET 5 (in case they fixed it somehow, but nope):
    With "An Enigmatic Treasure With A Recondite Discovery" and "The Pursuance of an Inscrutable Reciprocity",
    the leak happens. With "Tarnhill_V1" it doesn't. Tarnhill's readme does not contain images.
    However, the leak also does NOT happen with "Feast of Pilgrims", whose readme DOES contain an image.

    https://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/desktopdev/mstech/winforms-richtextbox-and-a-memoryleak/
    Tried this (putting ClearUndo()) after every content-loading thing, and it doesn't do jack squat.
    Doesn't do jack squat in the test project either.
    -Test with WPF project: The WPF RichTextBox does NOT leak memory on TPOAIR.
    -WPF implements its RichTextBox from scratch... and it's MIT licensed. So good, some RichEdit-compatible
     (presumably) code exists that I could use to make a custom control in some way, possibly.

    2022-01-18:
    The leak is 100% on Windows' side. Tested with WordPad loading "Enigmatic Treasure" over and over, and it
    exhibits the same behavior: constantly increasing memory.
    Note that even disposing the RichTextBox, and even using reflection to get the "IntPtr moduleHandle" field
    and calling FreeLibrary() on it, STILL doesn't release the unmanaged memory.
    We would have to put it in an entirely separate process and do like RichTextBoxAsync (but without the async)
    and then just restart the process whenever our memory use gets too high. Or, just use WPF's version through
    an ElementHost.

        Hack to work around a memory issue...

        When the handle is destroyed, it gets the RTF (through StreamOut, returning a string containing the RTF)
        and assigns the string to a field:

        --- snip ---

        protected override void OnHandleDestroyed(EventArgs e)
        {
            base.OnHandleDestroyed(e);
            if (!this.InConstructor)
            {
                this.textRtf = this.Rtf;
                if (this.textRtf.Length == 0)
                    this.textRtf = (string)null;
            }
            this.oleCallback = (object)null;
            SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged -= new UserPreferenceChangedEventHandler(this.UserPreferenceChangedHandler);
        }

        --- snip ---

        At first this seems pointless, to allocate a potentially multi-megabyte string for seemingly no reason.
        Reading the code, it looks like it's so that it can store the RTF string through a handle recreation.
        Okay, fair I guess if that's needed, but for us, it just wastes a ton of memory for absolutely no reason
        whatsoever. We never recreate the handle and the only time we destroy is it implicitly when we're shutting
        down anyway. Previously, we would spike our memory usage right before shutdown, which is dumb.

        We could set Rtf = "" in the main form closing handler. Except...

        --- snip ---

        public string Rtf
        {
            get
            {
                if (this.IsHandleCreated)
                    return this.StreamOut(2);
                if (this.textPlain == null)
                    return this.textRtf;
                this.ForceHandleCreate();
                return this.StreamOut(2);
            }
            set
            {
                if (value == null)
                    value = "";
                if (value.Equals(this.Rtf))       // <- this line here
                    return;
                this.ForceHandleCreate();
                this.textRtf = value;
                this.StreamIn(value, 2);
                if (!this.CanRaiseTextChangedEvent)
                    return;
                this.OnTextChanged(EventArgs.Empty);
            }
        }

        --- snip ---

        Yeah... it _also_ streams out the rtf into a string just to do a comparison. So. Yeah.

        The only choice - short of just copy-pasting the entire RichTextBox control code and straightening it all
        out to not be dumb* - is to just suppress the base OnHandleDestroyed() method. Probably a fantastically
        bad idea in general, but in our particular case it's fine because we're about to close the app anyway,
        so cleanup doesn't matter.

        *Basically impossible. It has too many tentacles too deep into the entire framework. Ugh.
