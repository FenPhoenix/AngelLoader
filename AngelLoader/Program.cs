    -The graphics (large image from icon and AngelLoader name image), loaded in the splash screen, combined
     take ~10ms (and that's including the creation of the dark mode version of the AL name image). Meh.

    -We could parallel-load the AngelLoader text image here, though we can't theme it because we won't know
     the theme until we read the config file.
