March 27, 2023:
-Fixed a shadowed-variable bug which caused Cyrillic detection to often fail.
-Changed the API to return enum members rather than strings, but they can be indexed into a string table if you want the encoding names. This helps my particular use case by making it easier to avoid extra allocations.
-Removed code for detecting encodings that aren't supported by .NET.
-Generally cleaned up the code.
